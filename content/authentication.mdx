## Required Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` | All `/v1` endpoints |
| `Accept-Encoding` | `gzip` | All `/v1` endpoints |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | POST endpoints only |

```text Required Headers
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Accept-Encoding: gzip
```

Both `Authorization` and `Accept-Encoding` headers are required for all authenticated requests.

## Error Responses

Invalid or missing API keys return `401 Unauthorized`. Exceeding your monthly quota returns `403 Quota Exceeded`.

See [Errors & Limits](/docs/rate-limits) for full error response formats and status codes.

## Key Rotation

Rotate your API key from the [dashboard](https://cs2.sh/dashboard).
Rotating generates a new key and immediately invalidates the old one.
