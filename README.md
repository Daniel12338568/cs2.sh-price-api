# The pricing API for Counter-Strike 2.

[cs2.sh](https://cs2.sh/) is an all-in-one pricing API that provides real-time and historical price data for Counter-Strike 2. Purpose-built to power developers, websites, and marketplaces.

Collecting, processing, and aggregating price data across all items & all major marketplaces is hard. We handle the headaches: tracking variant items, storing long-term historical data, and managing a stable market_hash_name schema. So you can focus on what matters.

Price APIs for Buff, Youpin, CSFloat, Steam, Skinport, and C5Game.
